I got it to work on Windows 7, 32 and 64 bit. There is ONE dependancy that you need to have installed (and you probably already have it): it's called "Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package". You can download it here: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555

This does NOT run on Windows XP. I have absoutly no idea why, but I'll get it eventually.

Fixed god-awful bug that happened because I "wanted to make it pretty". That'll show me.
